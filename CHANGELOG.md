# MFO — Changelog

Versions are immutable once released. Bump `VERSION` for every build that
reaches the game.

## v0.4.0 — scope cut, co-save v2, and the probe harness

**Read this one before installing** — it changes the save schema and removes a
feature.

### Spell acquisition is out of scope

MFO does gambits. It no longer teaches followers spells. *A Fun Way To Level
Followers* (TrumanAE, SKSE, open source) already does that properly — skill
points per player level, perks and spells at 20/40/50/60/80/100, configurable
so it works with any perk or spell overhaul.

The split: **they own acquisition** (how a follower comes to know Fireball),
**MFO owns deployment** (when they should cast it).

This is synergy rather than deconfliction. MFO's aptitude gate reads a
follower's skills to decide what vocabulary they're offered, and without a
levelling system those values barely move — the gate is nearly static. Their
mod makes it live: spend skill points, and MFO's vocabulary opens in response.

Deleted with it: the tutored-spell ledger, the revoke path, the
`RemoveAddedSpells` backstop, and the reconcile-on-load. **That was the
largest remaining surface in MFO that could damage another mod's state** — a
mis-scoped revoke would have eaten spells another mod granted. MFO now adds no
spells or perks to any actor, ever.

MFO's derived action vocabulary still reads whatever a follower knows, so a
spell from a levelling mod, a perk overhaul, or a quest all appear identically
with no patch.

### Co-save schema v2

**v1 saves are still readable**; the v1 reader consumes and discards the old
tutored block. Nothing is lost that MFO owned, and spells already on an actor
are untouched — MFO never held them, it only remembered granting them.

*Why the bump:* the tutored block was first removed at v1 without one, on the
reasoning that no save had ever held an MFO record. That was true when written
and expired as soon as saving with the mod active was on the table — and
v0.3.0 already writes v1 *with* that block, so a v0.3.0 save read by this
build would have misparsed with no guard able to catch it. "Nobody has data
yet" is a fact with an expiry date; a version number is not.

What a save actually carries right now is 14 bytes per follower, all
fixed-width: FormID, rapport, rank, table count, two zero rule counts, zero
overrides. No strings, no form references — those arrive with the evaluator.

### The Probe tab (M4)

A new tab in the Field Kit: pick a follower, fire one engine primitive, watch
what happens. Nothing persists. Its centrepiece is the **target-retention
watch** — press *StartCombat*, and it samples the follower's actual combat
target every tick, comparing by handle rather than name, distinguishing "the
commanded target died" (invalidation) from "the engine re-picked" (a problem),
and reporting how long the commanded target actually survived.

That single measurement decides whether the standing-order model in the design
holds or needs a refresh cadence, and it cannot be answered by reading any
source.

**It already produced its most valuable finding before running.** Review
established that **five of the twelve primitives the design lists as Tier B
have no C++ binding in CommonLibSSE-NG**: `KeepOffsetFromActor`,
`ClearKeepOffsetFromActor`, `SetDontMove` and `DoCombatSpellApply` are
Papyrus-only, and `StartCombat` exists only in po3's fork. The research was
sound — the Papyrus surface named the right engine flows — but *"a Papyrus
native exists"* and *"I can call it from C++"* are different claims and only
the first had been checked. Positioning probes are therefore **blocked** and
shown as such in the UI rather than quietly omitted.

### Also
- `bSeedTestData` writes synthetic rules onto a player-keyed record. Leave it
  **off** for real play; turn it on to exercise the co-save.
- FormID `0x802` shipped as the granted-spell keyword and is now reserved and
  unused. FormIDs are never recycled.

## v0.3.0 — kills actually get credited

Field fixes from reading a real session log. The reported symptom was "boss
multiplier didn't apply"; the log showed something worse underneath it.

**Kills were being silently dropped.** A follower transiently absent from the
engine's high-actor list was removed from the tracked set instantly — and the
death sink refreshes that set *before* awarding, so a kill landing in that
window credited nobody at all. The log signature was a remove and re-add
**117 ms apart**, far tighter than the 500 ms refresh. Now held for three
consecutive missed sweeps: one miss is not evidence of absence.

**The log had gone blind to Rapport.** Awards only logged on a rank change,
so the overlay made Rapport visible in game and invisible in the log in the
same release. Every award and every credited kill now logs at info —
including the zero case — with victim name, both levels, and classification.

**Boss detection was wrong, as reported.** `IsUnique()` means *named one-off
actor*, not *hard fight*; generic dungeon bosses are leveled and not unique,
so a bandit chief with a boss bar read as standard. Now unique **or** at
least `iBossLevelDelta` levels above you (default 5) — relative, so a chief
is a boss at level 8 and an inconvenience at 50. Tunable in `MFO.ini`.

**The panel explains itself.** Measurements now shows the last credited kill:
name, its level, your level, the classification, and what was awarded to how
many followers. "Why wasn't that a boss?" is answerable without a log.

*Two of these became this project's first invariants earned in the field
rather than inherited from a sibling (#22i, #22j).*

*Note: `[cosave] saved 0 follower record(s)` appeared in a session with no
manual save — autosave and quicksave fire regardless of intent. Harmless with
seeding off, but worth knowing that "not saving" is not under your control.*

## v0.2.0 — the Field Kit (in-game overlay)

Everything v0.1.0 had, now **visible in game**. Reading a log after the fact
is a hopeless loop for a behaviour mod, so the overlay was pulled forward
from M7.

**⚠ First code hooks in the project.** Three trampoline hooks (D3DInit,
DXGIPresent, InputDispatch) install at plugin load, **before** the renderer
exists, and they install regardless of any INI setting. Offsets and thunk
shapes are transcribed from MEO's shipped, field-validated implementation and
were confirmed against it in review — but **this build has never run**. If the
game hard-crashes on launch, this is the suspect, and `bShowHud = 0` will not
help because the hooks are already in by then.

**The HUD** — top-right, passive, draws every frame and takes **no input**, so
it stays readable while fighting. Per follower: name, combat flag, rank,
rapport, live health/magicka/stamina bars, distance. Plus session kills,
rapport, and rapport/hour. This is the primary observation surface; the panel
is for detail. `bShowHud` in `MFO.ini`.

**The panel** — the **Field Orders** power opens it; Esc, gamepad B, or the
shout key closes it. Three tabs:
- *Followers* — the full table, **including retained-but-inactive records**,
  so dismissal being non-destructive is visible rather than taken on faith.
- *Measurements* — the two numbers this build exists to take: the
  teammate-filtered combat-event rate, and kills/rapport per hour. The
  rapport/hr figure turns amber below 30, which is the case where
  `BALANCE.md`'s rank ladder needs redoing.
- *Config* — what is actually in force, plus quirk-table resolution.

Full controller parity throughout (family standing rule): gamepad nav, stick
edge-triggered into d-pad, B to close.

**Also**
- Test seeding moved to `bSeedTestData` in `MFO.ini`, **default off**. With it
  off and no saving, **MFO writes nothing anywhere** — it reads state and
  draws it.
- Detection refresh 2 s → 500 ms so the HUD reads as live.
- Log now lands in the MO2 profile's `overwrite/SKSE/Plugins/MFO.log`,
  alongside every other plugin's, rather than in the wine prefix.

**Validated in-game (from v0.1.0 testing)** — follower detect/undetect across
three cycles with records retained, form resolution to the ESL band, SPIT
type 3 correct for a castable lesser power, `TESSpellCastEvent` firing for
lesser powers. See `ENGINE_NOTES.md` §0.

**Still unproven, deliberately:** the co-save (no saving with MFO active yet),
all of Rapport (no kills have occurred), and combat-event volume.

**Review:** Fable pre-CI review found one blocker — a software mouse cursor
that would have been composited over ordinary gameplay from the moment the
renderer came up — plus four majors including a mutex-nesting violation of the
project's own invariant and an input-swallow divergence from the reference.
All fixed before this build.

## v0.1.0 — first testable build

Detection, Rapport, and the co-save. **No gambit execution yet** — the
evaluator arrives at M5. This build exists to prove the foundations before
anything is built on them.

**What it does**
- Loads, resolves its forms, and grants the **Field Orders** power.
- Detects followers framework-agnostically: teammate status as the gate, plus
  a quirk table that revokes eligibility for custom followers who signal
  dismissal their own way (Inigo's `WaitingForPlayer == -1`, Vilja's and
  Tindra's factions). Summons excluded by default and never persisted.
- Accrues **Rapport** per follower from shared kills — combat state carries
  the archery case, a radius fallback carries the stealth case — with boss
  ×5 and dragon ×10, and ranks I–V driving both slot ladders.
- Round-trips all of it through the SKSE co-save, with `ResolveFormID` on
  every FormID and per-rule disable (never whole-list drop) for missing
  targets.

**How to observe it.** There is no UI until M7. Press **Field Orders** at any
time to dump a full state report to the log: config in force, the quirk
table, active followers with their eligibility flags, every stored record
including dismissed ones, and the two measurements this build exists to take
— teammate-filtered combat-event rate, and kills/hour.

**Log location.** `<MO2 instance>/overwrite/SKSE/Plugins/MFO.log`. MFO writes
game-root-relative so USVFS lands its log beside every other plugin's, rather
than in the wine prefix where `SKSE::log::log_directory()` would put it.

**Known and deliberate**
- Ships with seeded test gambits on a player-keyed record (`kP0SeedTestData`),
  so the co-save round-trip is provable without a UI. **Use a throwaway save.**
- MCM settings need a restart; there is no live re-read sink until M7.
- The combat-exit survival award is not implemented; `fRapportSurvival` is
  parsed but unused.
- `BALANCE.md`'s rank thresholds rest on an **unmeasured** ~45 rapport/hour
  estimate. Taking that measurement is the main purpose of this build.

**Engineering notes**
- Zero code hooks. Event sinks only (death, combat, spell-cast), so there is
  no Address Library exposure in the core loop.
- Passed a pre-CI Fable review that caught two save-corruption paths — a
  diagnostic that inserted records via `operator[]`, and an unguarded path
  that could persist runtime `0xFF` FormIDs — plus six behaviour defects,
  including a kill counter that counted every death in the world rather than
  party kills.
