# MFO — Changelog

Versions are immutable once released. Bump `VERSION` for every build that
reaches the game.

## v0.1.0 — first testable build

Detection, Rapport, and the co-save. **No gambit execution yet** — the
evaluator arrives at M5. This build exists to prove the foundations before
anything is built on them.

**What it does**
- Loads, resolves its forms, and grants the **Field Orders** power.
- Detects followers framework-agnostically: teammate status as the gate, plus
  a quirk table that revokes eligibility for custom followers who signal
  dismissal their own way (Inigo's `WaitingForPlayer == -1`, Vilja's and
  Tindra's factions). Summons excluded by default and never persisted.
- Accrues **Rapport** per follower from shared kills — combat state carries
  the archery case, a radius fallback carries the stealth case — with boss
  ×5 and dragon ×10, and ranks I–V driving both slot ladders.
- Round-trips all of it through the SKSE co-save, with `ResolveFormID` on
  every FormID and per-rule disable (never whole-list drop) for missing
  targets.

**How to observe it.** There is no UI until M7. Press **Field Orders** at any
time to dump a full state report to the log: config in force, the quirk
table, active followers with their eligibility flags, every stored record
including dismissed ones, and the two measurements this build exists to take
— teammate-filtered combat-event rate, and kills/hour.

**Log location.** `<MO2 instance>/overwrite/SKSE/Plugins/MFO.log`. MFO writes
game-root-relative so USVFS lands its log beside every other plugin's, rather
than in the wine prefix where `SKSE::log::log_directory()` would put it.

**Known and deliberate**
- Ships with seeded test gambits on a player-keyed record (`kP0SeedTestData`),
  so the co-save round-trip is provable without a UI. **Use a throwaway save.**
- MCM settings need a restart; there is no live re-read sink until M7.
- The combat-exit survival award is not implemented; `fRapportSurvival` is
  parsed but unused.
- `BALANCE.md`'s rank thresholds rest on an **unmeasured** ~45 rapport/hour
  estimate. Taking that measurement is the main purpose of this build.

**Engineering notes**
- Zero code hooks. Event sinks only (death, combat, spell-cast), so there is
  no Address Library exposure in the core loop.
- Passed a pre-CI Fable review that caught two save-corruption paths — a
  diagnostic that inserted records via `operator[]`, and an unguarded path
  that could persist runtime `0xFF` FormIDs — plus six behaviour defects,
  including a kill counter that counted every death in the world rather than
  party kills.
