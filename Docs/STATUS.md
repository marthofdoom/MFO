# MFO — Current Status & Handoff

## Continue in one screen

- **Latest shipped & deployed:** **v1.0.33** ("weapon-stance ownership") — the
  Auri melee fix. When an equip gambit wins a follower's hand, MFO swaps their
  LIVE per-combat `combatStyle` (0x38) to `MFO_MeleeStyle`/`MFO_RangedStyle` on
  the combat thread from the UpdateCombat hook, so the engine stops re-drawing
  the weapon MFO didn't pick (the bow<->mace ping-pong). Default ON
  (`bWeaponStyleControl`, INI-only, no MCM). Fable-reviewed pre-commit.
  **Deck-verified (DLL e954b7bc…), GitHub Release = Latest** (CI run 31127627267;
  the push didn't auto-fire the workflow — transient Actions hiccup — so it was
  `gh workflow run`-dispatched, still HEAD's native tree). Field test pending —
  watch `[wstyle] … OWNED/HANDOFF`; does Auri hold the mace, no flicker?
- **v1.0.32** ("mage fixes") — deck-verified (DLL 1542ab83…), GitHub Release =
  Latest. marth reports casting "drastically improved" in the field (v1.0.32
  validating; confirm the pacing/potion watch-items still hold).
- **Compile is CI-only.** No local MSVC. The DLL only ever comes from a GREEN
  GitHub Actions `native` run whose `native/` tree matches HEAD. Never trust
  "it built" without `gh run list --workflow=native --status=success` + a
  headSha/tree match. (INVARIANTS #44; verify-ci-green memory.)
- **ESP is generated** by `python3 MFO_GenerateESP.py out` (Linux, no Creation
  Kit). ESP changes = edit the generator + regen. (ARCHITECTURE §8.)
- **Release** = two-phase `release.sh` (see its header). Phase 1 stamps+pushes→CI;
  phase 2 (after green) regens ESP, runs `audit_esp.py`, pulls the green DLL,
  packages `releases/vX/`.
- **Deploy** = unzip the package over `/mnt/gaming/modlists/custom-modlist/mods/MFO/`
  only (keep `meta.ini`), force a syncthing rescan, then poll the deck until its
  DLL sha256 matches the packaged one. (deploy-workflow memory has the exact
  commands + the syncthing key handling.)
- **Publish hygiene:** subagents do code→CI→deploy→tag; the **main agent** (in
  direct conversation with marth) runs `gh release create`. Keeps the public
  publish anchored to marth's authorization. (release-scope memory.)
- **Repo hygiene:** only `main` exists locally and on origin (feature/worktree
  branches were cleaned 2026-08-05). GitHub Releases exist for every tag
  v0.7.0→v1.0.31 (the v0.8.24–v0.8.48 gap and all v1.0.x were backfilled).

## Shipped this cycle (all deployed to deck + GitHub Release)

| Ver | What | Field-test status |
|---|---|---|
| v1.0.25/26 | Furniture-ejection fix: evict follower to an XMarker (never the player) + load-sweep un-latches old saves | marth reported furniture works; treat resolved |
| v1.0.27 | Hybrid forced-cast (force the gambit spell on AI miss) + line-of-sight gating (worker posts, raycast on main thread, cached verdict) | **pending** — watch `[los]`; does `HasLineOfSight` discriminate NPC→NPC on this runtime? (fail-open by design) |
| v1.0.28 | Exclusive cast control — while a cast gambit owns him, DENY every spell but the gambit's (was casting his own too) | **pending** — watch `[consent] … DENIED own spell` |
| v1.0.29 | Magic-user loadout — school robes + backup dagger + 2 MCM toggles (bMagicLoadout, bMageDaggersOnly) | superseded in part by v1.0.31; MCM toggles BROKEN (see #55) |
| v1.0.30 | Cast latch persistence — suppression holds through the cast cooldown, not just the fire (closes the between-casts leak) | **pending** — watch `[consent] … holding exclusive control through the cast cooldown`; no `(their own spell, not ours)` while a cast rule wins |
| v1.0.31 | Pure casters: mages loot NO rated armor (heavy or light), robes/clothing only; broadened school-robe detection; per-candidate apparel diagnostics; no junk picks | **pending** — watch `[loot] apparel …` diag lines; is Marcurio switching to his valid robe / out of heavy armor? |
| v1.0.33 | **Weapon-stance ownership** — equip gambits own the follower's live per-combat `combatStyle` (melee/ranged CSTY 0x833/0x834), applied on the combat thread from the UpdateCombat hook; reverts at battle end, hands off melee↔ranged. Stance follows the winning gambit, not the class (mage-melee / mage-ranged work). Default ON, `bWeaponStyleControl` INI kill-switch. | **pending** — watch `[wstyle] … OWNED/HANDOFF`; does Auri now hold the mace and stop plinking? Does she stop the bow↔mace flicker? |
| v1.0.32 | **Mage fixes** — forced casts actually fire (FindInput template-map fallback + static uids; CastAt only, cast_self stays barred: QNAM+t6 zero-precedent cell); cooldown-consulted permit (`permitAfter` on the latch — no more 4-casts-in-2.2s bursts); potion-exempt deny (only formType Spell is ever denied); flicker-proof latch (deny holds for the combat's duration; releases only on combat end/dismissal/revert); + INI-gated P1 combat-style probe (`bProbeCastStyle`, default OFF, new CSTY 0x832 `MFO_CastStyle`) | **pending** — watch `[cast] … FORCED … at …` (real animated force, no more `template input 'Spell'` errors), `[consent] … pacing` once per window, no suppressed combat drinking, `DENIED own spell` continuity across flickers; probe (only if armed): `[probe cstyle]` |

## Open field threads (awaiting marth's deck — pull the log, then diagnose)

The deck runs the game; MFO.log is at
`deck@marthdeck:~/Games/custom-modlist/overwrite/SKSE/Plugins/MFO.log`.
**CAVEAT: MFO.log is TRUNCATED every game launch** (one file, no backup) — the
session with a bug is gone after a relaunch. To catch something, marth must
reproduce it in the CURRENT session, then pull the log before the next launch.
(Offered but undecided: add an `MFO.log.prev` backup-on-load so sessions aren't
lost — small, safe; do it if marth confirms.) Deck may be ASLEEP → SSH timeout,
just retry ([[deck-sleeps-ssh-timeout]]).

1. **Auri melee switch — FIXED + FIELD-VALIDATED (v1.0.33, 2026-08-06).** Deck
   log: clean `OWNED -> ranged`, `HANDOFF -> melee`, `HANDOFF -> ranged` — she
   holds the stance, no more 6×/fight bow↔mace thrash. **`RE-DERIVED: 0`** — the
   live `combatStyle` swap HOLDS on 1.6.1170, engine never stomps it. That
   field-proves the CSTY-swap rails for Stage 2 (caster style swap) and makes the
   P1 probe fully unnecessary. History below:
   The deck log showed it was NOT the STATUS hypotheses: she carries a Glass Mace
   (dmg 84), `rule 1 act.equip_melee` fires, and she DID equip melee 6× — but
   the equips were *real* re-equips (a bow↔mace tug-of-war with her own ranged-
   weighted AI), so she flickered and never attacked. Fixed by weapon-stance
   ownership (v1.0.33): the melee gambit now swaps her live combat style so the
   AI stops re-drawing the bow. Confirm on deck: `[wstyle]` shows OWNED melee,
   she holds the mace, no flicker.
2. **P1 combat-style probe — largely OBVIATED by v1.0.33.** The probe's core
   MECHANICAL question ("does writing `combatStyle` on the live per-combat
   controller HOLD, or does the engine re-derive it?") is now answered for free
   by the v1.0.33 weapon-stance feature, which does exactly that swap on the
   RELIABLE UpdateCombat hook (all combatants) and logs re-derives explicitly
   (`[wstyle] … engine RE-DERIVED …`). So `bProbeCastStyle` need not be run
   separately for that. The probe's OTHER question (does a caster-forward style
   make him cast MORE / mobile) is cast-specific and folds into Stage 2 below.
3. **v1.0.31/1.0.32 field confirms** — see the shipped table's watch items
   (Marcurio switching to robes; forced casts firing animated, paced, potions
   flowing, no mid-flicker leak).

## Open issues (ranked)

0. **HEADLINE — casting overhaul (next Nexus = "mage fixes").** Research (task #59)
   found the v1.0.27 forced cast had **never fired on deck** — it errored
   `template input 'Spell' is not declared on FE090820` and silently fell to the
   invisible `CastSpellImmediate`. **v1.0.32 SHIPPED (task #60), deck-verified:** fixed the
   dead forced cast (Packages.cpp `FindInput` — template nameMap on a MISS not
   just null; static uid fallback Spell=3/Target=4; scoped to CastAt — CastSelf
   stays barred via `Decline::SelfRoute`, the CTD-class t6+QNAM cell), cooldown-
   consulted permit (`permitAfter` on the latch), potion-exempt deny (only
   formType==Spell), flicker-proof latch (combat-duration hold), + the INI-gated
   **P1 combat-style probe** (`bProbeCastStyle`, default OFF; CSTY 0x832) to
   de-risk Stage 2. Field test pending (watch items in the table above).
   **Stage 2 (#59, the headline toggle `bFullCastControl`, default OFF) — NEXT,
   IN PROGRESS.** marth green-lit it 2026-08-06 ("just in case people want very
   tight control of casters"), to build right after v1.0.33 deploys. Own every
   decision the AI's cast machinery consults (deny-all + spell-scoring 0x0C +
   CalcCastMagicChance 0x08 + swap combatStyle 0x38 to an MFO caster CSTY) →
   100% vanilla-animated+mobile, MFO owns what/when/whom. **The combatStyle-swap
   leg now rides the PROVEN v1.0.33 rails:** extend the unified CombatStyle
   ownership with an `MFO_CastStyle` stance driven by CAST gambits on the
   UpdateCombat hook, instead of the fragile CheckStartCast-driven probe. Still
   gated on 5 open design questions for marth (force the exact gambit spell vs
   bias-to-cast; caster-CSTY aggressiveness; override target selection too; etc.
   — see task #59).
   **Also folded into this mage update (marth, 2026-08-06):** **#61 fashionrim**
   (armor-only dolls toggle — disables armor looting, the mage school-robe
   loadout, armor auto-equip, MEO gem transfer, armor buy/sell; weapons
   untouched). #61 is specified as an MCM toggle and **depends on #55** (broken
   MCM registration) or it's a dead checkbox — so the mage cut must either fix
   #55 first or ship #61 INI-gated like `bWeaponStyleControl`/`bFullCastControl`.

1. **#55 — MCM new toggles = empty, unresponsive checkboxes on existing saves.**
   RECURRING ("as per usual"). All file touch points verified correct (atomic,
   parse, ResetToDefaults, kMcmDefaults heal table, config.json control, Settings
   ini, seed ini); live deck store has the keys = 1 under `[General]`; no MCM
   parse error. So it's MCM Helper NOT REGISTERING the new ModSettings for an
   existing save (control draws, nothing bound). `EnsureMcmDefaults` (append to
   store ini at kInputLoaded) is insufficient. FIX: diagnose empirically (diff a
   working installed mod that adds toggles across updates — the "read the data"
   rule) + add a `tools/audit_mcm.py` **release gate** checking every toggle's
   touch-points are consistent, so broken MCM can't ship. marth: "please never
   release broken mcm options."
2. **#48 — retreat didn't relocate; StopCombat fix (v1.0.24) needs validation.**
   Watch `[retreat] moved=` in the next outmatched fight; escalate to a Flee
   package if `moved≈0`.
3. **#24 — retreat threshold tuning** (fire sooner, chase-leash) — pending values
   with marth.
4. **#31 — autonomous town errands** (walk-to-merchant / door nav) — the headline
   NEXT FEATURE; generalises the loot-travel `Packages.*`/`Logistics.*` machinery.
5. **#29 — MEO v1.0.8** finalize (strip `[wdiag]`, bump, release) — *different mod*
   (marth's Equipment Overhaul), same dev flow.

## Backlog (captured, not scheduled)

- **POST-MAGE-UPDATE — add armor/weapon BUY to the economy** (marth 2026-08-06).
  The economy currently BUYS only consumables (potions/arrows/bolts — Logistics
  `addNeed` covers kPotHealth/Stamina/Magicka, kArrows, kBolts); it never buys
  armor or weapons. Add gear-buy needs + TradeBridge matching. When added, gate
  it behind #61 fashionrim (`bDollsMode` blocks armor ACQUISITION — buy included).

- **~~Economy selling socketed items~~ — NON-ISSUE (resolved 2026-08-06).** It was
  marth using a `resurrect` console command, not the economy selling. No bug; the
  log correctly showed zero `[econ]`/sell events. (Kept as a note so it isn't
  re-investigated.)
- **#56 — Combat overlay X/Y position adjuster** (now folded into the mage cut) —
  MCM sliders (or live drag) into the overlay's ImGui window pos (Board.cpp);
  controller nudge per the family rule.
- **#57 — Matching armor sets (MCM toggle, default OFF).** NOT per-piece: a
  set-COLLECTION state machine — the follower collects a better set's pieces
  (holds them, doesn't wear piecemeal, and the economy must NOT sell in-progress
  set pieces) until the set is COMPLETE, then equips it all at once; with a
  piecemeal OVERRIDE when a single piece is a big enough upgrade to wear now.
  Stateful + save-persisted + economy sell-exemption → focused later build.
- **#61 — "fashionrim" / my-followers-are-dolls debug toggle** (rolls into the mage
  update). Default-OFF Debug MCM toggle. **ARMOR ONLY for now:** disables armor
  looting, the mage school-robe loadout, armor auto-equip, MEO gem transfer on
  armor swaps, and armor buy/sell (partial). WEAPONS unaffected — weapon
  switching, weapon looting, ammo, weapon trade all still work. Warnings cover the
  armor breakage. Depends on #55 (MCM registration fix) or it's a dead checkbox.
- **#58 — Recognize framework followers (Kaidan, Inigo, Lucien).** Custom-framework
  voiced followers with bespoke quest/AI systems, not the vanilla follower faction
  path MFO detects. Reverse-engineer each one's active-follower signal from its
  installed ESP + Papyrus scripts (read the source — they expose no API), assess
  gambit/AI interop, document the mechanism in ENGINE_NOTES. Verify which are in
  marth's modlist first (primary sources).
