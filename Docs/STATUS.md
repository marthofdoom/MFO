# MFO — Current Status & Handoff

> **LIVING DOC — KEEP THIS CURRENT.** This is the first thing to read to continue
> MFO from a clean slate. Update it *in the same change* whenever you: ship a
> release, open/resolve an issue, get a field-test result back from marth, or
> change the workflow. A stale status doc is worse than none — if you touch the
> project and don't touch this, you've left the next session a trap.

## Continue in one screen

- **Latest shipped & deployed:** **v1.0.31**. **v1.0.32** ("mage fixes") is
  BUILT and pushed; CI run 31072217444 in progress — NOT yet deployed or
  published. When CI is green: phase 2 → deploy → tag → main agent publishes.
- **Compile is CI-only.** No local MSVC. The DLL only ever comes from a GREEN
  GitHub Actions `native` run whose `native/` tree matches HEAD. Never trust
  "it built" without `gh run list --workflow=native --status=success` + a
  headSha/tree match. (INVARIANTS #44; verify-ci-green memory.)
- **ESP is generated** by `python3 MFO_GenerateESP.py out` (Linux, no Creation
  Kit). ESP changes = edit the generator + regen. (ARCHITECTURE §8.)
- **Release** = two-phase `release.sh` (see its header). Phase 1 stamps+pushes→CI;
  phase 2 (after green) regens ESP, runs `audit_esp.py`, pulls the green DLL,
  packages `releases/vX/`.
- **Deploy** = unzip the package over `/mnt/gaming/modlists/custom-modlist/mods/MFO/`
  only (keep `meta.ini`), force a syncthing rescan, then poll the deck until its
  DLL sha256 matches the packaged one. (deploy-workflow memory has the exact
  commands + the syncthing key handling.)
- **Publish hygiene:** subagents do code→CI→deploy→tag; the **main agent** (in
  direct conversation with marth) runs `gh release create`. Keeps the public
  publish anchored to marth's authorization. (release-scope memory.)
- **Repo hygiene:** only `main` exists locally and on origin (feature/worktree
  branches were cleaned 2026-08-05). GitHub Releases exist for every tag
  v0.7.0→v1.0.31 (the v0.8.24–v0.8.48 gap and all v1.0.x were backfilled).

## Shipped this cycle (all deployed to deck + GitHub Release)

| Ver | What | Field-test status |
|---|---|---|
| v1.0.25/26 | Furniture-ejection fix: evict follower to an XMarker (never the player) + load-sweep un-latches old saves | marth reported furniture works; treat resolved |
| v1.0.27 | Hybrid forced-cast (force the gambit spell on AI miss) + line-of-sight gating (worker posts, raycast on main thread, cached verdict) | **pending** — watch `[los]`; does `HasLineOfSight` discriminate NPC→NPC on this runtime? (fail-open by design) |
| v1.0.28 | Exclusive cast control — while a cast gambit owns him, DENY every spell but the gambit's (was casting his own too) | **pending** — watch `[consent] … DENIED own spell` |
| v1.0.29 | Magic-user loadout — school robes + backup dagger + 2 MCM toggles (bMagicLoadout, bMageDaggersOnly) | superseded in part by v1.0.31; MCM toggles BROKEN (see #55) |
| v1.0.30 | Cast latch persistence — suppression holds through the cast cooldown, not just the fire (closes the between-casts leak) | **pending** — watch `[consent] … holding exclusive control through the cast cooldown`; no `(their own spell, not ours)` while a cast rule wins |
| v1.0.31 | Pure casters: mages loot NO rated armor (heavy or light), robes/clothing only; broadened school-robe detection; per-candidate apparel diagnostics; no junk picks | **pending** — watch `[loot] apparel …` diag lines; is Marcurio switching to his valid robe / out of heavy armor? |
| v1.0.32 | **Mage fixes** — forced casts actually fire (FindInput template-map fallback + static uids; CastAt only, cast_self stays barred: QNAM+t6 zero-precedent cell); cooldown-consulted permit (`permitAfter` on the latch — no more 4-casts-in-2.2s bursts); potion-exempt deny (only formType Spell is ever denied); flicker-proof latch (deny holds for the combat's duration; releases only on combat end/dismissal/revert); + INI-gated P1 combat-style probe (`bProbeCastStyle`, default OFF, new CSTY 0x832 `MFO_CastStyle`) | **pending** — watch `[cast] … FORCED … at …` (real animated force, no more `template input 'Spell'` errors), `[consent] … pacing` once per window, no suppressed combat drinking, `DENIED own spell` continuity across flickers; probe (only if armed): `[probe cstyle]` |

## Awaiting marth's field test (deck log watch items)

The deck runs the game; MFO.log is at
`deck@marthdeck:~/Games/custom-modlist/overwrite/SKSE/Plugins/MFO.log`.
The v1.0.31 `[loot] apparel {id} … primAV/assocSkill/secAV/arch/mag/kw -> school`
lines are the channel to fix robe-detection *from data* if a valid robe still
reads score=0.

## Open issues (ranked)

0. **HEADLINE — casting overhaul (next Nexus = "mage fixes").** Research (task #59)
   found the v1.0.27 forced cast had **never fired on deck** — it errored
   `template input 'Spell' is not declared on FE090820` and silently fell to the
   invisible `CastSpellImmediate`. **v1.0.32 BUILT + in CI (task #60), not yet
   deployed/published:** fixed the
   dead forced cast (Packages.cpp `FindInput` — template nameMap on a MISS not
   just null; static uid fallback Spell=3/Target=4; scoped to CastAt — CastSelf
   stays barred via `Decline::SelfRoute`, the CTD-class t6+QNAM cell), cooldown-
   consulted permit (`permitAfter` on the latch), potion-exempt deny (only
   formType==Spell), flicker-proof latch (combat-duration hold), + the INI-gated
   **P1 combat-style probe** (`bProbeCastStyle`, default OFF; CSTY 0x832) to
   de-risk Stage 2. Field test pending (watch items in the table above).
   **Stage 2 (#59, the headline toggle `bFullCastControl`, default OFF):**
   own every decision the AI's cast machinery consults (deny-all + spell-scoring
   0x0C + CalcCastMagicChance 0x08 + swap combatStyle 0x38 to an MFO caster CSTY) →
   100% vanilla-animated+mobile, MFO owns what/when/whom. Depends on the P1 probe
   result + 5 open design questions for marth (see task #59).

1. **#55 — MCM new toggles = empty, unresponsive checkboxes on existing saves.**
   RECURRING ("as per usual"). All file touch points verified correct (atomic,
   parse, ResetToDefaults, kMcmDefaults heal table, config.json control, Settings
   ini, seed ini); live deck store has the keys = 1 under `[General]`; no MCM
   parse error. So it's MCM Helper NOT REGISTERING the new ModSettings for an
   existing save (control draws, nothing bound). `EnsureMcmDefaults` (append to
   store ini at kInputLoaded) is insufficient. FIX: diagnose empirically (diff a
   working installed mod that adds toggles across updates — the "read the data"
   rule) + add a `tools/audit_mcm.py` **release gate** checking every toggle's
   touch-points are consistent, so broken MCM can't ship. marth: "please never
   release broken mcm options."
2. **#48 — retreat didn't relocate; StopCombat fix (v1.0.24) needs validation.**
   Watch `[retreat] moved=` in the next outmatched fight; escalate to a Flee
   package if `moved≈0`.
3. **#24 — retreat threshold tuning** (fire sooner, chase-leash) — pending values
   with marth.
4. **#31 — autonomous town errands** (walk-to-merchant / door nav) — the headline
   NEXT FEATURE; generalises the loot-travel `Packages.*`/`Logistics.*` machinery.
5. **#29 — MEO v1.0.8** finalize (strip `[wdiag]`, bump, release) — *different mod*
   (marth's Equipment Overhaul), same dev flow.

## Backlog (captured, not scheduled)

- **#56 — Combat overlay X/Y position adjuster** — MCM sliders (or live drag) into
  the overlay's ImGui window pos (Board.cpp); controller nudge per the family rule.
- **#57 — Matching armor sets (MCM toggle, default OFF).** NOT per-piece: a
  set-COLLECTION state machine — the follower collects a better set's pieces
  (holds them, doesn't wear piecemeal, and the economy must NOT sell in-progress
  set pieces) until the set is COMPLETE, then equips it all at once; with a
  piecemeal OVERRIDE when a single piece is a big enough upgrade to wear now.
  Stateful + save-persisted + economy sell-exemption → focused later build.
- **#58 — Recognize framework followers (Kaidan, Inigo, Lucien).** Custom-framework
  voiced followers with bespoke quest/AI systems, not the vanilla follower faction
  path MFO detects. Reverse-engineer each one's active-follower signal from its
  installed ESP + Papyrus scripts (read the source — they expose no API), assess
  gambit/AI interop, document the mechanism in ENGINE_NOTES. Verify which are in
  marth's modlist first (primary sources).

## Where knowledge goes

See INDEX.md's routing table. Durable facts about *this session's* mechanisms are
already in the memory store (furniture latch, cast spell-choice, LoS worker-safe
pattern, MCM schema, release scope/publish hygiene). Engine findings → ENGINE_NOTES
§0; incident-born rules → INVARIANTS; symptom→cause→fix → DEBUGGING.
